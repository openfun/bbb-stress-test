# A stress testing tool for BigBlueButton

## Overview

This is a stress testing tool for [BigBlueButton](https://bigbluebutton.org/).

It simulates client activity (listening only, with microphone and/or webcam) thanks to [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) and [Selenium Python bindings](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/).
Each client is a browser running in a virtual framebuffer (with `xvfb`), launched inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.

The audio input is generated with [espeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/) and [Fortune-mod](https://launchpad.net/fortune-mod). The webcam input is generated by [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

2) Run `make .env` and update the `.env` file to specify `BBB_URL` and `BBB_SECRET`.\
You can get these values by running `bbb-conf --secret` on your BBB server.

### Ready to launch your test ?

1) Manually start a meeting on your BBB server.

2) Get the meeting id by running `make list-meetings`

3) Update your `.env` file to set the following variables :
   - `BBB_MEETING_ID` : the meeting ID
   - `BBB_CLIENTS_LISTEN_ONLY`: the number of simultaneous clients to connect in "Listen only" mode
   - `BBB_CLIENTS_MIC_ONLY` : the number of simultaneous clients to connect with an active microphone
   - `BBB_CLIENTS_WEBCAM_MIC` : the number of simultaneous clients to connect with an active webcam + microphone
